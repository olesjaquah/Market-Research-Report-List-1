<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Adaptive Servo Ventilators ASV Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Volume Triggered</li><li>Flow Triggered</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Adaptive Servo Ventilators (ASVs) are advanced devices designed for patients with sleep-disordered breathing, notably central sleep apnea. The market for ASVs is mainly categorized into two types: volume-triggered and flow-triggered. Volume-triggered ASVs deliver a set tidal volume, adjusting pressure to meet this target, while flow-triggered ASVs respond to the patientâ€™s breathing efforts by measuring airflow and providing airflow-dependent pressure support. Both types enhance patient comfort and optimize ventilation strategies, improving treatment outcomes in sleep therapy.</p></p>
